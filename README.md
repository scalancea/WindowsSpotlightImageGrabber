# WindowsSpotlightImageGrabber
This is a simple NodeJS script to grab all the lockscreen images from Windows Spotlight cache

To use it, just run:
```batchfile
npm install
node app.js

All the grabbed images will reside in a subfolder named `spotlightPictures` located in the same folder as `app.js`
